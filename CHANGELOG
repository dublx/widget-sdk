## Unreleased - 2015-06-15

### Added

    - Expose `api.contentType` that contains name of content type used, data on all the fields in the entry, current display field and sys data.
    - Expose `api.space.getPublishedEntries` and `api.space.getPublishedAssets`. These methods also let you filter by asset/entry.
    - Expose `api.field.removeValue` which can be used to remove the value for a field from the data model.
    - Expose `api.field.onIsDisabledChanged`. It takes a callback which is fired when the disabled status of the field changes.
    - Expose `api.field.setInvalid`. It can be used to communicate validation status of the field to the Contentful web application.
    - Expose `api.field.type`
    - Expose `api.entry.field[id].onIsDisabledChanged(locale, handler)`

### Changed

    - Field focus/blur status is communicated internally to the Contentful web application for the styles to work correctly.

### Fixed

    - Fix `api.field.onValueChanged` firing on the tab that _performed_ the update. This was not in line with documented behaviour.

## 0.1.1 - 2015-02-23

### Fixed

    - Ensure compatibility with Contentful Content Management App deployed at the same day.
    - Fix example widgets `widget.json`s `src` localhost urls to be`contentful-widget` cli compatible.

## 0.1.0 - 2015-02-16
