### Added

    - Expose `widget.contentType` that contains name of content type used, data on all the fields in the entry, current display field and sys data.
    - Expose `widget.space.getPublishedEntries` and `widget.space.getPublishedAssets`. These methods also let you filter by asset/entry.
    - Expose `widget.field.removeValue` which can be used to remove the value for a field from the data model.
    - Expose `widget.field.onIsDisabledChanged`. It takes a callback which is fired when the disabled status of the field changes.
    - Expose `widget.field.setInvalid`. It can be used to communicate validation status of the field to the Contentful web application.
    - Expose `widget.field.type`
    - Expose `widget.entry.field[id].onIsDisabledChanged(locale, handler)`

### Changed
